<!doctype html><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" /></head><body><p><span style="font-family: courier new;">Hi everyone<br><br>The Baptist Church Register is a large volume (an ABC Index Book<br>actually) with each page divided in half so that the names of two<br>families can be recorded on each page. At the top of each section is<br>the fathers name e.g. Robert Webb and his wife Mary and then the<br>children are listed beneath the parents. In some cases, where the<br>maiden name of the wife is known, then it would be Mary born Smith for<br>example. The first few in the register did not record the maiden name<br>of the mother. Since there are no entry numbers I have used the page<br>numbers instead. The handwriting is fairly good in this register,<br>although sometimes the spelling is suspect! There is no mention of the<br>name of the minister, but by looking at some of the marriage<br>certificates I have identified the handwriting as being that of Rev<br>Alexander Hay.<br><br>Register of the Church of Christ called Baptist in Grahamstown<br>CORY MS 16 850D.1 Vol 1<br>Minister: Rev Alexander Hay<br>Transcribed by: Tessa King<br><br>Page No. 013<br>Surname: GREEN<br>Christian Names: James<br>Fathers Names: John<br>Mothers Names: Margaret<br>Mothers Maiden Name: KIRKMAN<br>Date of Birth: 25 Sept 1838<br>Where Born: Grahamstown<br><br>Page No. 013<br>Surname: GREEN<br>Christian Names: George William<br>Fathers Names: John<br>Mothers Names: Margaret<br>Mothers Maiden Name: KIRKMAN<br>Date of Birth: 18 May 1841<br>Where Born: Oliphants Hoek<br><br>Page No. 013<br>Surname: GREEN<br>Christian Names: Mary Ann<br>Fathers Names: John<br>Mothers Names: Margaret<br>Mothers Maiden Name: KIRKMAN<br>Date of Birth: 02 Nov 1843<br>Where Born: Not recorded<br><br>Page No. 013<br>Surname: GREEN<br>Christian Names: John<br>Fathers Names: John<br>Mothers Names: Margaret<br>Mothers Maiden Name: KIRKMAN<br>Date of Birth: 24 May 1846<br>Where Born: Not recorded<br><br>Page No. 013<br>Surname: GREEN<br>Christian Names: Henry Benjamin<br>Fathers Names: John<br>Mothers Names: Margaret<br>Mothers Maiden Name: KIRKMAN<br>Date of Birth: 22 Feb 1851<br>Where Born: Philipton</span></p>
