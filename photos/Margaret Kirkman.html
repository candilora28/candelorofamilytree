Life in South Africa was hard, as described in her history in the John Green Record Book (published by the Green Family Organization): "Besides the hardships of building homes, the Kaffir tribes continued to harass the settlers. They were constantly in danger of attack."<br><br>On 22 Dec 1835 at St George's Anglican Church in Grahamstown she married John Green, Jr., whose family were also settlers of 1820.<br><br>She emigrated from South Africa to the United States in 1863, along with all but one of her living children. She was a Utah Pioneer, arriving in Salt Lake City 4 Sep 1863 in Captain A.H. Patterson's Independent Company. Her husband and daughter Mary Ann (who was married) stayed behind in South Africa. Family tradition has it that her husband John Green was going to dispose of their property and join her in the US the following year, but as it turned out, he never did make it and died in South Africa in February 1883.<br><br>This is how she is described in two different histories: <br><br>"Margaret Kirkman Green was a tender-hearted woman with a loving disposition and firm in her convictions; she was a lover of peace, a defender of truth, obedient to law, submissive to the authority of God, pure in thought and actions, and never permitted her tongue or lips to speak evil. By her kindly disposition, her gentleness of manners and the abundance of love which she possessed, she not only held a powerful influence over her children, but she gathered around her many friends, all of whom felt their lives had been made better by having known and associated with such a person. She met the problems of life bravely and tried to solve them cheerfully and without complaining, confident that the Lord had been kind to her and her family in bestowing many blessing upon them."<br><br>"She was a frail woman, rather delicate, but wherever there was sickness, there you would find Margaret Kirkman Green... She was an invalid for several years before her death and confined most of the time to her bed, but in it all she never faltered in her faith or shrank from duty."<br><br>Daughter of John KIRKMAN &amp; Mary Alice ASHWORTH.<br><br>These children are not listed in the family links below: <br>John Albert, Mary Ann.<br> <br> <br>Family links: <br> Spouse:<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=32623519">John Green (1813 - 1882)</a><br> <br> Children:<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=30835507">James Kirkman Green (1838 - 1903)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=125640">George William Green (1841 - 1908)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=31174939">John Green (1846 - 1930)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=31175030">Henry Benjamin Green (1851 - 1875)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=39468164">Margaret Matilda <em>Green</em> Peterson (1853 - 1919)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=5377330">Joseph Brigham Green (1856 - 1916)</a>*<br> <a class="NoUnderline12point" href="fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=31175176">Hannah Martha <em>Green</em> Williams (1857 - 1938)</a>*<br> <br> <span class="minus1">*<span class="fakeLink" title="">Calculated relationship</span></span></td>
